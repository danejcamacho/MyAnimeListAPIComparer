# MyAnimeListAPIComparer

## What does it do?
Implements a main menu for the CLI which allows users to access and compare their anime lists from the website: https://myanimelist.net/

## How does it do it?
Uses the MAL API as defined here: https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2

## How do I use this?
Run mal.py with the python3 command
You will only be able to use functions that use publicly available information such as comparing public lists

You can get your own API key to add and subtract from your own anime list
